# COP1000C

This repository contains my work for the class COP1000C taken at Valencia College. It is a beginner programming class consisting of C and is required to take for more advanced programming classes.

**Note**: Assignments are 1 behind as one assignment was a document. So if Atlas says "Assignment 05" this GitHub will say "Assignment 04".

Need help setting up GitHub for this class with Visual Studio? Follow this tutorial [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QyirnIi777dO6ObDTcETPsf5tKQVbafatSbCWfimaTw/edit?usp=sharing "here").
