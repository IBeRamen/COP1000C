# COP1000C

This repository contains my work for the class COP1000C taken at Valencia College. It is a beginner programming class consisting of C and is required to take for more advanced programming classes.

**Note**: Assignments are 1 behind as one assignment was a document. So if Atlas says "Assignment 05" this GitHub will say "Assignment 04".
